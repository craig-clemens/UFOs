# UFOs
 ## Project Overview
 The overall goal of this project was to create a webpage with a table that returned filtered results of sightings of UFOs. Originally the webpage provided users with the ability to filter by date. To complete our challenge we added additional filters for city, state, country and shape of the unidentified object.

 ## Results
 Originally the webpage only allowed filtering by date and a user was required to press a button to apply the filter. In this version we removed the button and added other options for the data to be filtered by. Here we simply enter the data and the webpage automatically filters the table, displaying the required data. The first photo represents the webpage without an applied filter. The second image shows the webpage when filtered by the city of El Cajon.

 ## Summary
 One major drawback in regards to this project is that there is no way for the user to add their own extraterrestiral experiences to the dataset. If someone was interested enough to seek out this information they may have something to add. A survey form or contact information should and can be easily added.

 Additionally, this webpage does not format well on mobile devices:

 Further formatting could be added so that the image resizes for mobile or tablet devises, and so that the margins of the page are automatically adjusted on other devices.
